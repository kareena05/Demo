c# intro
c# datatypes and variables
structs
enum
class
constructor and its types

int vs short-> 4byte ,2byte
float,double,decimal = F,D,M main difference is precision ,F=7,D=15,M=28
string s=@"abc" -> does not require extra backslash for escaping and can accept multiline string
string s2="abc" -> will require a closing " in a same line,if you press enter it will concatenate,requires extra backslash for escaping 
enum:
step1: define enum
step2: create variable of defined enum
enum is declared outside the class and doesnot contain any space but can contain special character

difference:
String vs string
struct enum record classes
struct and class => struct is value type & stored in stack  class=> reference type & stored in heap
inheritance is supported in struct
default constructor is not supported in struct

	static class can not be inherited
	static class has no instance
	static class has static members only-> static fields and static methods

	static methods can only modify the static fields

	abstarct class is a blueprint for other classes
	a derived class must implement all its methods

	A static constructor is used to initialize the static data members,
	the normal constructor (non-static constructor) is used to initialize the non-static data members.

	str_name.ToUpper()
	str.name.ToLower()
	string strRes = str1.Insert(2, "bbb")
