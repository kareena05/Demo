install angular cli-
npm install -g @angular/cli


check version of angular
ng version

create new project
ng new blog


run project
ng serve 

package.json
has the details that which command will build ,test the project,has the names and versions of libraries that are installed

nodemodules-
has the libraries

when u use npm install node_modules folder will be re-installed(ex:another person takes the pull or you accidently delete the node_modules folder
)

src folder-
developer does its 99% work in this directoryx

app-has component files
assets-css or image files

environment-for deploying(create build to test,create a build for live)
index.html - file that loads first
main.js -> connects the  index file to have an angular code

package.lock.json->has the detailed dependencies of a library in package .json

angular.json
configuragation file
by default which html css js typescript files will run 
 
tsconfig-typescript configuration

tsconfig.json->global configuration
tsconfig-app.json->application level configuration
tsconfig-spec.json->testing level configuration

browserlistrc->which browsers do we support

karma.config.js->to write testcases for testing

polyfills-> adds libraries to support the browser that is giving weird output 

interpolation->displaying dynamic data to from ts file to html pages
ts file can have properties,functions etc
you can write js code to call the function from ts file or to print the value of property
{{getName()}}   {{title}} 
-you can use the value of ts variable as a class


things you can't do with interpolation:
-assignement operator does not work,you can't assign value to ts property
-you can't check the typeof variable
-increament, decrement operator does not work
-you can't use new keyword  



you can do the things with command line rapidly
creating components,library etc rather than doing it manually
 

command to generate component
ng generate component login
or
ng g c login

the above command generates 4 files that are necessary to create component

module apne aap me ek feature hota h
module is complex than component
ex:register module can have multiple components like signup,login,logout etc


ng generate module [modulename]
ng g m userAuth
ng g c userAuth/signup


what is build?
build kese bnate hai?

command ->ng build
we create a minified file and put it on server so that are app can run on server


create component and use it as an html tag 
by refering it by its selector name , you will find selector name in component's ts file 

you can change name of the selector in ts file


css file in component will not be generated using below command
(use this approach when you don't need much css)
ng g c login --inline-style
(you can write css in the ts file itself)

html file in component will not be generated using below command
(use this approach when you don't need much html)
ng g c login --inline-template
(you can write html in the ts file itself)
(ex: search box)

if you want html and css in a single file , use
ng g c login --inline-template --inline-style 

after creating a module register it in app.module.ts in imports section


and to allow you component inside your module to be publicly available you have to export it inside the exports

<input type="text" placeholder="Enter name" #box3 (keydown)="getVal(box3.value)"/>


give id like this: #box
access value of name property or placeHolder property or the value of input
box.name
box.placeholder
box.value	



you can place the css in global style.css file that is common 

inline css > component css > global css
priority of css:


property binding is for setting properties of HTML elements(like src,disabled , href etc), while interpolation is for inserting dynamic values directly into the text content of HTML elements. Both techniques are ways to display dynamic data in Angular templates

Interpolation creates problem while working with boolean values


there is no option for else if else if conditions in angular u have to use the <Sng-template [ngIf]="color==='green'">

angular for loop and js for loop both are different . js loop can be used in ts file

h1 [style.color]="color"
here color is the property from ts file
and
h1 [style.color]=" 'color' "

here color is treated as it is
